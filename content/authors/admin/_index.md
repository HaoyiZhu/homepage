I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) advised by Prof. [Tong He](https://tonghe90.github.io/), Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). I earned my B.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence Honor Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. [Cewu Lu](https://mvig.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also have had the privilege of working with Dr. [Hao-Shu Fang](https://fang-haoshu.github.io/) and Dr. [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me/). 

*Research for fun and truth.* My current research interests focus on World Model, Embodied AI and Spatial Intelligence. The ultimate goal of my life is to *discover myself, find the truth, and change the world!* Feel free to follow me on [<i class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/HaoyiZhu) and [<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/HaoyiZhu) for latest research announcements and updates!

In my personal life, I am passionate (but amateur) about football, music, literature, philosophy, [traditional Chinese painting](#gallery), and [modern Chinese poems](#poems)!

*"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it."*
